                <p id="content">King Vidura, renowned for his devotion, renounced his opulent home to seek spiritual wisdom. He questioned Maitreya Ṛṣi about the meeting between Vidura and Maitreya, reflecting the significance of Vidura's inquiries. Śukadeva Gosvāmī narrated how Dhṛtarāṣṭra's blindness, caused by his attachment to his dishonest sons, led to the peril of the Pāṇḍavas. Despite Draupadī's humiliation and Yudhiṣṭhira's unfair gambling defeat, Dhṛtarāṣṭra remained indifferent, leading to the exile of the virtuous Yudhiṣṭhira. Vidura, summoned for counsel, advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to return Yudhiṣṭhira's rightful share, warning of impending danger from the vengeful Bhīma. He urged Dhṛtarāṣṭra to abandon envy and embrace righteousness. However, Vidura faced scorn from Duryodhana and left the palace, unaffected by worldly attachments.
                <br>
                Embarking on a pilgrimage, Vidura visited sacred sites and met Uddhava, inquiring about Lord Kṛṣṇa's family. He sought news of various relatives, including Yudhiṣṭhira's rule, Bhīma's disposition, and the well-being of Krishna's family members. Despite the turmoil caused by Dhṛtarāṣṭra's actions, Vidura lamented not for himself but for the misguided king. He emphasized the greatness of the Lord's actions and urged Uddhava to glorify Him, highlighting Krishna's transcendental nature and His merciful presence among devotees.</p>

                <p id="content">When Vidura asked Uddhava about Lord Krishna's messages, Uddhava was initially overwhelmed with anxiety. From childhood, Uddhava had been deeply devoted to Krishna, forsaking even meals to serve Him. His lifelong service continued, and upon being questioned about the Lord, he entered a state of deep remembrance and ecstasy. Vidura observed Uddhava's intense absorption and tears of love, realizing his profound connection with Krishna.
                <br>
                After a moment of silence, Uddhava spoke sorrowfully, expressing concern for their well-being in Krishna's absence. He lamented the Yadu dynasty's misfortune for failing to recognize Krishna's divinity, comparing them to fish unable to perceive the moon. Despite their expertise and association with Krishna, they could only recognize Him as the Supreme but failed to realize His intimate nature.
                <br>    
                Uddhava reminisced about Krishna's pastimes, experiencing distress at His departure and separation from loved ones. He recounted Krishna's divine birth, childhood adventures, and protection of devotees from various adversities. Uddhava expressed pain at the demons' enmity towards Krishna, who, despite their hostility, displayed unparalleled mercy even towards a demoness like Putana. Reflecting on Krishna's pastimes, Uddhava lamented the inability of the demons to appreciate the Lord's divine nature.</p>

                <button onclick="readContent()"><b><i>SPEAK</i></b></button>
                <p id="content">Uddhava narrated various significant events from Lord Krishna's life to Vidura. He recounted Krishna's heroic actions, such as overthrowing the tyrant Kamsa in Mathura, learning all the Vedas in one hearing, and marrying Rukmini by defeating rival princes. Uddhava described how Krishna won Princess Nagnijiti's hand by subduing seven bulls and rescued the Parijata tree from heaven to please his wife, Satyabhama. He also mentioned Krishna's victories over demons like Narakasura and his benevolence towards their families.
                <br>
                Krishna's role in the Kurukshetra War was highlighted, where he advised Arjuna and orchestrated the demise of the opposing kings, including Duryodhana. Uddhava reflected on Krishna's concern for the future of the Yadu dynasty and his decision to leave the mortal world.
                <br>    
                In the aftermath of the war, Krishna established Yudhishthira as the ruler and protected him along with his brothers. Meanwhile, in Dwaraka, Krishna lived a life adhering to Vedic principles while enjoying the company of his wives and the Yadava dynasty.
                <br>    
                The narrative continued with Krishna's departure from the world and the Yadu dynasty's eventual demise due to a curse. The Yadavas, aware of their impending fate, went to Prabhasa to prepare for their final journey. They performed rituals, charity, and honored the Brahmins before bidding farewell to the mortal world.
                <br>    
                Through these accounts, Uddhava emphasized Krishna's divine nature, his compassionate acts, and the inevitability of his departure, leaving a lasting impact on Vidura and the listeners.</p>

                <p id="content">After witnessing the annihilation of his kinsmen, Uddhava, overwhelmed with grief, sought solace by the banks of the Sarasvati river, where he encountered the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krishna. Recognizing Krishna's divine form and feeling deeply affectionate, Uddhava approached him with folded hands.
                <br>
                Krishna, seated under a banyan tree, appeared cheerful despite renouncing all comforts. Maitreya, a devoted sage, arrived at the scene and listened attentively as Krishna imparted transcendental knowledge to Uddhava, acknowledging his unwavering devotion. Krishna revealed that Uddhava's current life was blessed, and he would soon attain Vaikuntha, the Lord's abode.
                <br>    
                Uddhava, expressing his longing for Krishna's association, shared his pain of separation. Krishna assured him of the significance of his visit and instructed him on self-knowledge, a wisdom passed down through generations.
                <br>    
                As Uddhava prepared to depart, Vidura approached him, seeking enlightenment. Uddhava directed Vidura to Maitreya, a repository of transcendental knowledge.
                <br>    
                Later, Uddhava recounted Krishna's disappearance and the profound discussions held with Vidura, alleviating Vidura's sorrow with his spiritual insights. Uddhava, following Krishna's instructions, journeyed to Badarikashrama to meditate and satisfy the Lord.
                <br>    
                Understanding the depth of Krishna's pastimes and his divine nature, Vidura was moved to tears, realizing Krishna's remembrance of him.
                <br>    
                Eventually, after spending some time by the Yamuna, Vidura proceeded to the Ganges, where he met the revered sage Maitreya, continuing his quest for spiritual enlightenment.After witnessing the annihilation of his kinsmen, Uddhava, overwhelmed with grief, sought solace by the banks of the Sarasvati river, where he encountered the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krishna.

                <p id="content">Vidura, embodying devotion and gentleness, sought wisdom from the revered sage Maitreya at the celestial Ganges' source. He expressed the futility of material pursuits and the longing for true happiness, beseeching guidance.
                <br>
                Vidura acknowledged the benevolence of philanthropic souls, emissaries of the Lord, and implored Maitreya for instructions on transcendental devotional service. He yearned to understand the Supreme Lord's incarnations and the cosmic manifestation's regulation.
                <br>    
                Maitreya, honoring Vidura's sincerity, commenced elucidating the Lord's transcendental activities. He revealed the pre-creation state, where the Lord, the sole observer, impregnated the dormant material energy, initiating the cosmic manifestation.
                <br>    
                Through the interactions of eternal time, the mahat-tattva manifested, and from it arose the false ego, the source of the material elements and the demigods. The demigods, recognizing the Lord's supremacy, offered prayers extolling His lotus feet as the ultimate refuge.
                <br>    
                Maitreya described the Lord's transcendental potency, which permeates all creation, from the sky to the earth. The demigods sought enlightenment on offering pleasing commodities to the Lord, acknowledging His unparalleled status as the source of all beings.
                <br>    
                They beseeched the Supreme Self for guidance in rendering service for subsequent creation. The Lord, unborn and unchanging, impregnates the cosmic energy, directing its evolution. The demigods sought His perfect knowledge and potency to fulfill their roles in creation's diverse departments.</p>

                <p id="content">The Ṛṣi Maitreya elucidated how the Supreme Lord rectified the suspension of universal functions by entering the elements with His external energy, Kālī. This act enlivened all living entities, akin to waking from slumber.
                <br>
                The integration of the twenty-three elements birthed the gigantic universal form, the viśvarūpa body, housing all planetary systems and creations. This virāṭ-puruṣa, named Hiraṇmaya, hosted all living entities for a celestial millennium.
                <br>    
                The mahat-tattva's total energy, as the virāṭ-rūpa, manifested consciousness, life force, and self-identity, enabling diverse expressions of life. This universal form, representing the Supersoul, accommodates countless beings and sustains creation.
                <br>    
                The Supreme Lord, prayed to by the demigods, separated into various forms to govern creation. Agni emerged from His mouth, Varuṇa from His palate, and Aśvinī-kumāras from His nostrils, facilitating taste and smell.
                <br>    
                The sun entered His eyes, enabling vision, while Anila, representing wind, entered His skin, allowing tactile perception. The directions' deities entered His ears for hearing, and Prajāpati entered His genitals, facilitating reproduction.
                <br>    
                Rudra, representing false ego, entered the materialistic ego, and Brahmā entered intelligence, fostering understanding. The moon demigod entered the heart, enabling mental speculation, and the mahat-tattva infused consciousness, allowing specific knowledge.
                <br>    
                The heavenly, earthly, and sky planets manifested from His head, legs, and abdomen, respectively, hosting beings of different qualities. From the arms came protection, from the thighs sustenance, and from the legs service, forming societal divisions.
                <br>    
                Maitreya concluded that the Lord's inconceivable potency transcends comprehension, underscoring the need for reverent obeisance. Thus, discussions of His glories, though incomprehensible, offer the highest perfection for humanity.</p>

                <p id="content">After Nārada's departure, Vyāsadeva retreated to a meditative cottage near the Sarasvatī River. Engaged in devotional service, he had a divine vision of the Absolute Personality of Godhead. Recognizing the power of devotional service to alleviate material miseries, Vyāsadeva compiled Vedic literature, including the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, for the benefit of humanity. Hearing these scriptures fosters love for Lord Kṛṣṇa, easing lamentation and fear.

                The narrative then shifts to the aftermath of the Kurukṣetra battle, where Aśvatthāmā, fearing for his life, deployed a nuclear weapon. Arjuna, guided by Kṛṣṇa, countered it, causing widespread devastation. Captured and brought before Draupadī, Aśvatthāmā faced conflicting responses. Draupadī, out of compassion and respect for his brāhmaṇa status, advocated for his release, while Bhīma and others sought his punishment.</p>

                <p>After the Kurukṣetra war, the grieving Pāṇḍavas, accompanied by Draupadī, visited the Ganges to offer water to their deceased relatives. Lord Kṛṣṇa, along with Yudhiṣṭhira and others, sought solace in the sanctified waters. Reflecting on the stringent laws of the Almighty, Lord Kṛṣṇa consoled the distressed.
                <br>
                Meanwhile, Duryodhana and his allies usurped Yudhiṣṭhira's kingdom, resulting in a conflict. With the Lord's grace, Yudhiṣṭhira regained his kingdom, and the unrighteous kings perished. However, the distress caused by Duryodhana's actions resulted in a shortened lifespan for him and his accomplices.
                <br>    
                Lord Kṛṣṇa facilitated three grand aśvamedha-yajñas for Yudhiṣṭhira, enhancing his virtuous reputation. Subsequently, as Kṛṣṇa prepared to depart, Uttarā approached Him in fear, seeking protection from Aśvatthāmā's lethal weapon aimed at her unborn child.
                <br>    
                Acknowledging the imminent danger, Lord Kṛṣṇa neutralized the weapon's effect, safeguarding Uttarā and her child. Kuntī, overwhelmed with gratitude, offered profound prayers to Kṛṣṇa, recognizing His omnipotence and compassion. She expressed her willingness to endure repeated calamities if it meant encountering Kṛṣṇa again.
                <br>    
                Kuntī's prayers depicted Kṛṣṇa's transcendental nature, his mysterious appearances, and his boundless mercy. The Lord's smile, in response to Kuntī's devotion, reflected His enchanting mystic power. Despite the efforts of sages and Kṛṣṇa himself to convince Yudhiṣṭhira to accept His departure, Yudhiṣṭhira remained overwhelmed by grief and self-condemnation, lamenting the consequences of the war and his role in it.</p>

                <p>Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by his brothers and Lord Kṛṣṇa, visited the dying Bhīṣmadeva on the Kurukṣetra battlefield. Bhīṣmadeva praised the Pāṇḍavas for enduring immense suffering while upholding righteousness. He attributed their tribulations to the inscrutable workings of time and acknowledged Kṛṣṇa's divine presence among them.
                <br>
                Bhīṣmadeva advised Yudhiṣṭhira to embrace his newfound responsibility as the ruler and protect the helpless citizens. He elucidated various religious duties, caste classifications, and the importance of detachment and attachment in action. Bhīṣmadeva concluded by meditating on Lord Kṛṣṇa's divine pastimes and requested to focus his mind on Kṛṣṇa at the time of death.
                <br>    
                As Bhīṣmadeva withdrew his consciousness into Lord Kṛṣṇa, his breathing ceased, and he merged into eternity. Witnessing this, everyone present offered respects, and drums were sounded in honor. After performing Bhīṣmadeva's funeral rites, Yudhiṣṭhira returned to Hastināpura with Lord Kṛṣṇa.
                <br>    
                In Hastināpura, Yudhiṣṭhira ruled the kingdom according to dharma, guided by the principles approved by Bhīṣmadeva and Lord Kṛṣṇa. The great sages praised Lord Kṛṣṇa and departed to their hermitages, carrying His divine presence within their hearts.
                <br>

                <p>After being reinstated in his kingdom by Lord Krishna, Maharaja Yudhisthira ruled justly and wisely, following the teachings of Bhishmadeva and Krishna. Under his reign, prosperity flourished, with abundant rainfall and bountiful harvests. The cow, symbolizing prosperity, freely provided milk, and all elements of nature paid homage to the king. Yudhisthira's rule ensured peace and contentment, as there were no enemies to disturb the citizens, and all enjoyed mental and physical well-being.
                <br>
                Lord Krishna, after pacifying His relatives in Hastinapura, bid farewell to Yudhisthira and departed. The departure was emotional, with the royal ladies and the Pāṇḍavas deeply saddened by the separation. Krishna was honored with drums, flutes, and showers of flowers as He left. His transcendental qualities were discussed by the ladies of Hastinapura, glorifying Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who creates, maintains, and annihilates the material world.
                <br>    
                As Krishna journeyed to Dwaraka, he was welcomed and worshiped in various provinces. Maharaja Yudhisthira, out of affection, accompanied Krishna for a distance along with the Pāṇḍavas, who were overwhelmed with the thought of separation. Eventually, Krishna reached Dwaraka, and along the way, He performed evening rites at each stop.
                <br>    
                The departure of Krishna marked an emotional yet spiritually enriching moment for all those involved, signifying the end of an era filled with divine presence and transcendental activities.

                <br>    
                Krishna is then welcomed by his queens in His palaces, where over sixteen thousand reside. They rejoice at His return, shyly covering their faces and exchanging glances with their beloved husband. Despite their beauty and charm, they cannot agitate Krishna's senses, as He remains unaffected by material allurements.
                <br>
                The queens, unaware of Krishna's supreme position, think of Him simply as their beloved husband, enjoying His company in their simplicity. Thus, they delight in His presence, unaware of His transcendental nature. Despite their unawareness, their devotion and affection for Krishna shine through in their interactions with Him.

                <br>
                Yudhisthira, expressing gratitude, recalled how Vidura had protected them during times of crisis. He inquired about Vidura's travels and if he had visited their friends in Dvaraka. However, Vidura chose not to disclose the tragic fate of the Yadu dynasty to spare the Pandavas further distress.
                <br>    
                Vidura advised Dhritarashtra to renounce worldly attachments and pursue a life of spiritual liberation. Dhritarashtra, guided by introspective knowledge, followed Vidura's counsel and left for the Himalayas with his wife, Gandhari.
                <br>

                <br>
                Upon Arjuna's return, his unprecedented dejection prompted Yudhisthira to inquire about their friends and relatives in Dvaraka, expressing concern for their well-being. He sought updates on Krishna's family, including his parents, wives, and sons, as well as other members of the Yadu dynasty and their associates.
                <br>    
                Arjuna assured Yudhisthira of the prosperity and safety of Krishna's family and their allies, describing their blissful existence under Krishna's protection. However, Yudhisthira's concern for Arjuna's own well-being led him to inquire about any possible mistreatment or difficulties Arjuna might have faced during his absence.

Arjuna reflected on Krishna's divine assistance during significant events like Draupadi's swayamvara, the battle with Indra, and the construction of the assembly hall.

                Arjuna highlighted Krishna's unparalleled strength, wisdom, and protection, crediting Krishna for his own achievements. He lamented the loss of Krishna's presence, which rendered his own prowess and accomplishments meaningless.
