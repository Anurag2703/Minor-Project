Despite the temporary nature of the experience, Nārada's intense longing for the Lord remained. He traversed the world, spreading the divine message and attaining liberation from material desires. Afterward, he emerged from Lord Nārāyaṇa during creation, endowed with a transcendental body. Nārada continues to roam freely, spreading the glories of the Lord through his vīṇā.

Draupadī, out of compassion and respect for his brāhmaṇa status, advocated for his release, while Bhīma and others sought his punishment.

Following Kṛṣṇa's directive, Arjuna removed Aśvatthāmā's jewel and expelled him from the camp. Despite Draupadī's plea, the punishment was deemed necessary for Aśvatthāmā's heinous actions.

Meanwhile, Duryodhana and his allies usurped Yudhiṣṭhira's kingdom, resulting in a conflict. With the Lord's grace, Yudhiṣṭhira regained his kingdom, and the unrighteous kings perished. However, the distress caused by Duryodhana's actions resulted in a shortened lifespan for him and his accomplices.

Lord Kṛṣṇa facilitated three grand aśvamedha-yajñas for Yudhiṣṭhira, enhancing his virtuous reputation. Subsequently, as Kṛṣṇa prepared to depart, Uttarā approached Him in fear, seeking protection from Aśvatthāmā's lethal weapon aimed at her unborn child.

He undertook severe penances for a thousand celestial years, controlling his mind and senses, exemplifying asceticism for all beings.

Pleased with Brahmā's penance, the Lord manifested His abode, Vaikuṇṭha, free from material influence, where demigods and demons alike worship Him. The inhabitants, adorned with celestial beauty, serve the Lord joyfully, accompanied by divine opulence and celestial music.

Brahmā, overwhelmed with joy upon seeing the Lord, was empowered to create. The Lord then instructed Brahmā on the confidential knowledge of creation, emphasizing devotional service. Brahmā, after re-creating the universe, instructed Nārada, who in turn taught Vyāsadeva, culminating in the narration of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.

This text elucidates the eternal truths of existence, the potency of devotional service, and the supreme position of the Personality of Godhead.

The material elements and living entities, influenced by modes of nature, are created by the Lord's mercy. The cycle of creation, maintenance, and dissolution is regulated by Him, culminating in the ultimate annihilation by Rudra.

The text emphasizes the transcendental nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, beyond the material conceptions depicted earlier. It clarifies that the Lord's direct interference in creation is to counteract the misconception of material nature as the creator.

Furthermore, it introduces the measurement of time and concludes with Śaunaka Ṛṣi's inquiry about Vidura's discussions with Maitreya and the reasons for his detachment from family and subsequent return, setting the stage for further elucidation by Sūta Gosvāmī.

Śukadeva Gosvāmī narrated how Dhṛtarāṣṭra's blindness, caused by his attachment to his dishonest sons, led to the peril of the Pāṇḍavas. Despite Draupadī's humiliation and Yudhiṣṭhira's unfair gambling defeat, Dhṛtarāṣṭra remained indifferent, leading to the exile of the virtuous Yudhiṣṭhira. Vidura, summoned for counsel, advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to return Yudhiṣṭhira's rightful share, warning of impending danger from the vengeful Bhīma. He urged Dhṛtarāṣṭra to abandon envy and embrace righteousness. However, Vidura faced scorn from Duryodhana and left the palace, unaffected by worldly attachments.

Embarking on a pilgrimage, Vidura visited sacred sites and met Uddhava, inquiring about Lord Kṛṣṇa's family. He sought news of various relatives, including Yudhiṣṭhira's rule, Bhīma's disposition, and the well-being of Krishna's family members. Despite the turmoil caused by Dhṛtarāṣṭra's actions, Vidura lamented not for himself but for the misguided king.

His lifelong service continued, and upon being questioned about the Lord, he entered a state of deep remembrance and ecstasy. Vidura observed Uddhava's intense absorption and tears of love, realizing his profound connection with Krishna.

After a moment of silence, Uddhava spoke sorrowfully, expressing concern for their well-being in Krishna's absence.

CANTO 3 (THE STATUS QUO):::::::CHAP 6

The Ṛṣi Maitreya elucidated how the Supreme Lord rectified the suspension of universal functions by entering the elements with His external energy, Kālī. This act enlivened all living entities, akin to waking from slumber.

The integration of the twenty-three elements birthed the gigantic universal form, the viśvarūpa body, housing all planetary systems and creations. This virāṭ-puruṣa, named Hiraṇmaya, hosted all living entities for a celestial millennium.

The mahat-tattva's total energy, as the virāṭ-rūpa, manifested consciousness, life force, and self-identity, enabling diverse expressions of life. This universal form, representing the Supersoul, accommodates countless beings and sustains creation.

The Supreme Lord, prayed to by the demigods, separated into various forms to govern creation. Agni emerged from His mouth, Varuṇa from His palate, and Aśvinī-kumāras from His nostrils, facilitating taste and smell.

The sun entered His eyes, enabling vision, while Anila, representing wind, entered His skin, allowing tactile perception. The directions' deities entered His ears for hearing, and Prajāpati entered His genitals, facilitating reproduction.

Rudra, representing false ego, entered the materialistic ego, and Brahmā entered intelligence, fostering understanding. The moon demigod entered the heart, enabling mental speculation, and the mahat-tattva infused consciousness, allowing specific knowledge.

The heavenly, earthly, and sky planets manifested from His head, legs, and abdomen, respectively, hosting beings of different qualities. From the arms came protection, from the thighs sustenance, and from the legs service, forming societal divisions.

Vidura expressed his illusion and requested enlightenment.

Maitreya elucidated that conditioned souls, in ignorance, perceive themselves as material, but through devotion to Vāsudeva, this misconception can be dispelled. He emphasized that by chanting the Lord's name, one can attain liberation from material sufferings.

Śrī Vidura requested the sage Maitreya to elucidate how Brahmā, the progenitor of the planetary inhabitants, fashioned the bodies of living beings from his own body and mind following the departure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Maitreya, feeling invigorated by Vidura's inquiry, began explaining in detail.

Brahmā, following the counsel of the Supreme Lord, engaged in penance for one hundred celestial years, then immersed himself in devotional service. He witnessed a violent wind shaking the lotus he sat upon, prompting him to consume both the wind and water through his transcendental knowledge.

Observing the lotus expand throughout the universe, Brahmā, in service to the Supreme Lord, divided it into three and later into fourteen divisions to accommodate diverse living entities. Brahmā's devotion and transcendental knowledge made him the foremost personality in the universe, capable of creating suitable habitats for various beings.

Maitreya then described eternal time as an unchangeable force, the primeval source of material interactions controlled by the Supreme Lord for His cosmic pastimes. He delineated the natural and vaikṛta creations, including the different species of plants, animals, and humans, each influenced by specific modes of material nature.

The sage further outlined the creation of demigods and other celestial beings by Brahmā, the universal creator empowered by the Lord's energy. Lastly, Maitreya detailed Brahmā's role as the passionate incarnation of the Supreme Lord in perpetuating universal affairs across millennia through unfailing desires.

CANTO 3 (THE STATUS QUO):::::::CHAP 12

The text describes the creation process undertaken by Brahmā, the progenitor of the universe. Initially, Brahmā created various aspects of material existence, including nescient engagements and the four great sages: Sanaka, Sananda, Sanātana, and Sanat-kumāra. However, when his sons declined his instruction to procreate and opted for liberation, Brahmā became angry and inadvertently generated Rudra, who was pacified and assigned his duties.

Rudra, also known as Śiva, was given eleven names and residences by Brahmā. He subsequently created many fierce offspring resembling him. Concerned by their destructive nature, Brahmā advised Rudra to engage in penance. Following this, Brahmā created ten sons, the Prajāpatis, and various aspects of material and spiritual knowledge emanated from him.

The Vedas, sciences, religious principles, and societal duties all originated from Brahmā's different faces and mouths. Additionally, the Purāṇas and histories, fire sacrifices, and societal divisions were established. The text concludes with the generation of Manu and Śatarūpā, who further increased the population through their offspring.

Despite this, Kaśyapa foretells the birth of Prahlāda, a great devotee whose fame will rival that of the Lord Himself.

He then narrated the journey of the four Kumaras, who, after wandering across the material and spiritual realms, reached Vaikuṇṭha, the abode of Lord Viṣṇu. There, they witnessed the unparalleled beauty and harmony of the spiritual world. Despite being barred entry by the doorkeepers, the sages remained composed.

They praised the Lord's exalted position as the protector of religion and acknowledged His inscrutable ways. The Lord assured that Jaya and Vijaya's exile from Vaikuṇṭha was sanctioned and prophesied their imminent return through intense yoga practice. As the sages departed, the Lord bid farewell to Jaya and Vijaya, assuring their eventual reunion. Subsequently, the demigods lamented as Jaya and Vijaya descended from Vaikuṇṭha and entered Diti's womb due to the Lord's divine plan. Brahmā concluded by affirming the Lord's supreme control over the universe and the futility of deliberating further on the matter.


CANTO 3 (THE STATUS QUO):::::::CHAP 17

The demigods, relieved upon Brahmā's explanation of the darkness's cause, returned to their celestial abodes. Diti, apprehensive of her sons' threat to the gods, gave birth to twins after a century-long pregnancy. The birth triggered ominous natural phenomena across the heavens and earth—earthquakes, fires, and celestial disturbances. Winds howled, trees uprooted, and darkness engulfed all. The ocean mourned, animals acted erratically, and ominous planets outshone auspicious ones. Marking these omens, except Brahmā's sage sons, fear gripped all, unaware of Jaya and Vijaya's fate. The demon twins, Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu, grew with extraordinary features, intimidating all. Prajāpati Kaśyapa named them, with Hiraṇyakaśipu invincible due to Lord Brahmā's boon. Hiraṇyākṣa served his brother devotedly, displaying immense strength and indomitable spirit. His intimidating demeanor terrorized even the gods, who hid from him. Upon returning from heaven, Hiraṇyākṣa challenged Varuṇa, the ocean's lord, who advised him to confront Lord Viṣṇu. Varuṇa warned of Viṣṇu's might and predicted Hiraṇyākṣa's defeat. Despite Varuṇa's counsel, Hiraṇyākṣa persisted, blinded by arrogance. Thus, the stage was set for the inevitable clash between Hiraṇyākṣa and the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu, ensuring the demon's downfall and the restoration of cosmic order.

Maitreya narrated how the Daitya, undeterred by Varuṇa's warning, sought out the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Encountering the Lord in His boar incarnation, the demon scorned Him as a mere amphibious beast. Defiantly, he declared the earth entrusted to his kind and challenged the Lord. Despite the demon's insults and threats, the Lord remained composed, bearing the pain of his abusive words. Brahmā and the demigods hailed the Lord's valor as He transferred His energy to the earth, enabling her to float on the water's surface. The demon, adorned with wealth and armaments, pursued the Lord with a mighty mace. However, the Lord, unperturbed, rebuked the demon's arrogance, prompting a fierce exchange between them. Brahmā, witnessing the intense battle, implored the Lord to swiftly vanquish the demon before the ominous hour arrived. Urging the Lord to use His infallible potency, Brahmā highlighted the auspicious time for victory, urging Him to eliminate the foe for the welfare of all. Recognizing the demon's impending doom as preordained by the Lord, Brahmā beseeched Him to swiftly dispatch the adversary and restore peace to the worlds.


CANTO 3 (THE STATUS QUO):::::::CHAP 19

After Brahmā's plea, the Lord, with a loving glance, accepted the prayer and heartily laughed. He then launched His mace at Hiraṇyākṣa, who struck back fiercely, causing the Lord's mace to slip from His hand. Despite the opportunity, Hiraṇyākṣa respected single combat, enraging the Lord further. The Lord invoked His Sudarśana discus as witnesses urged Him to dispatch the demon. Hiraṇyākṣa, seeing the Lord with lotus-petal eyes armed with Sudarśana, grew indignant and attacked. However, the Lord playfully dodged the mace, challenging Hiraṇyākṣa to try again. Seizing his mace once more, the demon roared and aimed it at the Lord, who effortlessly caught it. Humiliated, Hiraṇyākṣa took a trident and hurled it, only to have it shattered by the Lord's discus. Enraged, Hiraṇyākṣa attacked again, but the Lord, unperturbed, slapped him, and in retaliation, Hiraṇyākṣa struck the Lord's chest. Despite the blow, the Lord remained steady, and Hiraṇyākṣa's body was destroyed as if by a storm. Witnessing the battle, Brahmā marveled at Hiraṇyākṣa's blessed death. Addressing the Lord, the demigods praised His valor, and after defeating Hiraṇyākṣa, the Lord returned to His abode amidst a festival of praise. Vidura, hearing this narrative, attained transcendental bliss. Anyone who hears or chants this sacred tale is relieved of sinful activities and bestowed with merit, wealth, fame, and longevity.

Maitreya recounted how Devahūti, devoted to her husband Kardama Muni, served him with utmost love and respect, forsaking worldly desires. Impressed by her selflessness, Kardama praised her and offered her transcendental blessings. He then manifested an opulent aerial mansion for their conjugal pleasure, adorned with jewels, fine furnishings, and celestial comforts. Devahūti, initially disheartened by her appearance, was transformed into radiant beauty by the celestial maidens. With renewed vigor, she joyfully accompanied her husband to various celestial realms, relishing their marital bliss. As time passed swiftly, Kardama impregnated Devahūti with nine daughters through his yogic potency. However, upon realizing her husband's impending departure for ascetic life, Devahūti expressed her anguish, seeking solace and enlightenment. She acknowledged her past attachment to worldly pleasures but yearned for liberation through devotion to the Supreme Lord. Devahūti lamented her ignorance despite having the association of a saintly husband. She recognized the illusory nature of material pursuits and sought true spiritual advancement.

Recalling Lord Viṣṇu's words, sage Kardama assured Devahūti of her praiseworthiness, predicting the Supreme Lord's descent into her womb. He advised her to worship the Lord with faith, sensory control, austerities, and charity. Devahūti faithfully worshipped the Lord, who eventually appeared within her as her son, Kapila. The celestial celebration of His descent filled the universe with joy. Lord Brahmā, recognizing the divine presence, praised Kapila's imminent teachings on self-realization. He instructed Kardama to offer his daughters to the nine sages, thereby spreading his fame. Brahmā assured Devahūti of Kapila's ability to dispel ignorance. After Brahmā's departure, Kardama expressed gratitude and reverence to Kapila, seeking permission for ascetic life. Kapila, affirming His divine purpose, instructed Kardama to worship Him, promising eternal life and self-realization. He also vowed to enlighten Devahūti.

Kapila, pleased by her sincere inquiry, elucidated the highest yoga system, which leads to detachment from material happiness and distress. He explained the stages of consciousness, purification of the mind, and attainment of self-realization. Kapila stressed devotion as the auspicious path to perfection, highlighting the detachment of pure devotees and the transformative power of association with them.

He assured that devotees, absorbed in His service, are protected from material allurements and attain eternal liberation. The Lord concluded by asserting His supremacy and the necessity of unwavering devotion for ultimate perfection. Thus, through intense devotional practice, one transcends the cycle of birth and death, attaining the highest goal of life.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kapila, elucidated to his mother the categories of the Absolute Truth, essential for transcending the material modes. He delineated knowledge as the pinnacle of self-realization, capable of severing material attachments. Kapila expounded on the Supreme Soul, beyond material nature's influence, illuminating the cosmos with His self-effulgent presence. He described how the Supreme Lord accepted the subtle material energy, which, influenced by three modes, deludes living beings. Material consciousness binds the soul, compelling it to mistakenly identify with material activities. The conditioned soul's body, senses, and their presiding deities are products of material nature. Devahūti sought clarification on the Supreme Person and His energies, pivotal for creation's manifestation. Kapila explained the unmanifested pradhāna as the cause of creation, evolving into the manifested prakṛti. He detailed the elements and senses emerging from pradhāna, elucidating the process of cosmic evolution. The universe arose from the Supreme Lord's potency, its layers thickening successively. Ultimately, the Cosmic Being emerged from the universal egg, stimulated by the deities presiding over the senses. Only when the inner controller entered the heart did the Cosmic Being awaken from its dormant state. Kapila emphasized devotion, detachment, and spiritual knowledge as means to perceive the Supersoul within and beyond the body, facilitating transcendence.


CANTO 3 (THE STATUS QUO):::::::CHAP 27

The Personality of Godhead Kapila elucidated that when the living entity remains unaffected by material modes and does not claim proprietorship, he transcends material reactions, akin to the sun aloof from its water reflection. Yet, under material nature's influence, identifying with the body, he becomes absorbed in material activities, trapped in the cycle of transmigration. The duty then lies in engaging polluted consciousness in serious devotional service with detachment to gain control over mind and consciousness. Through the yoga system, one should progress to unalloyed devotion by chanting and hearing about the Supreme. Executing devotional service entails seeing all beings equally, practicing celibacy, being grave, offering results to God, and living modestly. By increasing spiritual knowledge, one transcends material consciousness, realizing freedom from false ego and seeing oneself as the soul. Liberation is attained through devoted service, firmly established in perfect knowledge and transcendental vision, removing the influence of material nature. By discerning the faultiness of material desires and becoming self-independent, one becomes enlightened, unaffected by material influences, and progresses towards spiritual perfection. Ultimately, through mercy, the devotee reaches the transcendental abode, beyond the power of death, fully absorbed in devotion to the Supreme.


CANTO 3 (THE STATUS QUO):::::::CHAP 28

The Personality of Godhead elucidated the system of yoga to concentrate the mind, leading to joy and progression towards Absolute Truth. By performing prescribed duties and worshiping the spiritual master, one should avoid unnecessary tasks and indulge in practices conducive to salvation. Practicing nonviolence, truthfulness, and austerity, while controlling the senses and focusing on the Supreme, aids in purification. Through breath control and meditation on the Supreme, one eradicates sin and material attachments, attaining freedom from the three modes of material nature. By concentrating on the form of the Supreme, adorned with divine attributes and opulence, the yogi visualizes the Lord within and experiences divine bliss. Meditating on each limb of the Lord's transcendental form, the yogi deepens devotion, ultimately realizing the Supreme Soul in all beings. Realizing the soul's distinction from the material body, the yogi transcends material identifications and perceives the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the seer of all. Understanding the manifestation of the soul through various material bodies, the yogi conquers illusion and achieves self-realization, firmly established in the Absolute Truth.

Devahūti, seeking the ultimate path of devotional service, implored Kapila to elucidate birth and death's perpetual cycle, hoping to cultivate detachment. She also requested a detailed explanation of eternal time, a manifestation of the Supreme's form, influencing pious acts. Kapila, moved by compassion, delineated various paths of devotional service based on qualities. Devotion in darkness, passion, or goodness corresponds to one's disposition. Unadulterated devotion entails unwavering absorption in the Supreme's transcendental name and qualities, akin to the Ganges flowing unimpeded to the ocean. Pure devotees eschew all forms of liberation, solely seeking the Lord's service. By achieving the pinnacle of devotional service, one transcends material modes, mirroring the Lord's transcendence. Dutifully performing prescribed duties, worshiping the Deity, and interacting compassionately comprise devotional practice. Such devotees see the spiritual master and all beings with reverence, avoiding association with the spiritually unadvanced. Through constant engagement in devotional service, one can perceive the Supreme Soul everywhere, transcending mere temple worship. The Supreme, as the time factor, orchestrates cosmic phenomena, inspiring awe and reverence. Fear of the Supreme motivates natural elements and celestial bodies, showcasing His omnipotence and control over creation. Thus, understanding the Supreme's omnipresence and supremacy, devotees dedicate their lives to His service, transcending material fears and attachments.


CANTO 3 (THE STATUS QUO):::::::CHAP 30

The Personality of Godhead elucidated the obliviousness of materialists to the inexorable influence of time, akin to clouds ignorant of the wind's potency. Despite toiling for material gains, time, personified as the Supreme, annihilates their endeavors, prompting lamentation. The deluded materialist, ignorant of his body's impermanence, erroneously perceives the transient as permanent, nurturing attachments to family, wealth, and home. Such attachment breeds satisfaction, masking existential anxieties. Despite suffering, the materialist clings to his familial and societal roles, driven by greed and sensual indulgence. Eventually, aging and infirmity befall him, leading to a pitiful existence dependent on others' charity. At death, he encounters the dread messengers of Yamarāja, apprehended for his sinful indulgences. En route to judgment, he endures excruciating punishments, symbolizing the consequences of his actions. Finally, after enduring various torments, he is purified and reincarnated, the cycle of suffering perpetuating until he seeks spiritual liberation. Lord Kapila concludes, affirming that those ensnared in sinful pursuits endure hellish lives even on Earth, reaping the consequences of their actions. Thus, one should transcend material entanglements and strive for spiritual enlightenment to break free from the cycle of birth and death.

The Personality of Godhead delineates the journey of the soul into the womb, detailing the gradual formation of the fetus. Despite the discomfort and distress experienced within the womb, the soul retains consciousness and beseeches the Lord for deliverance. Expressing gratitude for the mercy of the Supreme, the soul acknowledges its spiritual essence amidst material entanglement. As the fetus develops, it longs for liberation from the cycle of birth and death, seeking refuge in the lotus feet of the Lord. Eventually, propelled by the wind of destiny, the child is born, subjected to the vicissitudes of material existence. Through childhood and boyhood, the soul grapples with the illusions of the material world, seeking fulfillment in transient pleasures. However, the pursuit of sensual gratification only deepens the entanglement in material bondage. Warned against the allure of material distractions, the soul learns to discern the ephemeral nature of worldly attachments. By cultivating detachment and spiritual insight, one can transcend the illusion of material identity and navigate the world with purpose and equanimity. Thus, understanding the true nature of the self, one can transcend the cycle of birth and death and attain spiritual liberation.


CANTO 3 (THE STATUS QUO):::::::CHAP 32

The Personality of Godhead explains the consequences of materialistic pursuits, emphasizing attachment to sense gratification over devotional service. Those engrossed in mundane rituals and economic endeavors remain bereft of spiritual consciousness, continually entangled in material desires. Even if elevated to heavenly realms for temporary enjoyment, they eventually return to this material plane. Conversely, those immersed in Krishna consciousness find complete satisfaction and liberation from material modes. By executing duties with detachment and purified consciousness, one can transcend material bondage and enter the kingdom of God. Liberation is attained by approaching the complete Personality of Godhead, who orchestrates the material and spiritual realms. The text highlights the futility of material aspirations and the importance of taking shelter in the Supreme Lord for spiritual advancement. Those absorbed in fruitive activities, driven by passion and attachment, remain bound by material desires and are averse to devotional service. Such individuals are condemned for rejecting the nectar of the Lord's activities and indulging in mundane pursuits. Despite temporary elevation to heavenly realms, they eventually return to earthly existence, repeating the cycle of birth and death. Therefore, the text advises taking refuge in the Supreme Lord and engaging in Krishna consciousness for transcendental knowledge, detachment, and liberation from material entanglement.

Her austerities transformed her consciousness, and she attained liberation while still in her body. Devahūti's detachment increased, and she focused solely on the Supreme Lord, transcending bodily consciousness.
