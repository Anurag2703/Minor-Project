The Ṛṣi Maitreya elucidated how the Supreme Lord rectified the suspension of universal functions by entering the elements with His external energy, Kālī. This act enlivened all living entities, akin to waking from slumber.

The integration of the twenty-three elements birthed the gigantic universal form, the viśvarūpa body, housing all planetary systems and creations. This virāṭ-puruṣa, named Hiraṇmaya, hosted all living entities for a celestial millennium.

The mahat-tattva's total energy, as the virāṭ-rūpa, manifested consciousness, life force, and self-identity, enabling diverse expressions of life. This universal form, representing the Supersoul, accommodates countless beings and sustains creation.

The Supreme Lord, prayed to by the demigods, separated into various forms to govern creation. Agni emerged from His mouth, Varuṇa from His palate, and Aśvinī-kumāras from His nostrils, facilitating taste and smell.

The sun entered His eyes, enabling vision, while Anila, representing wind, entered His skin, allowing tactile perception. The directions' deities entered His ears for hearing, and Prajāpati entered His genitals, facilitating reproduction.

Maitreya, feeling invigorated by Vidura's inquiry, began explaining in detail.

Brahmā, following the counsel of the Supreme Lord, engaged in penance for one hundred celestial years, then immersed himself in devotional service. He witnessed a violent wind shaking the lotus he sat upon, prompting him to consume both the wind and water through his transcendental knowledge.

Observing the lotus expand throughout the universe, Brahmā, in service to the Supreme Lord, divided it into three and later into fourteen divisions to accommodate diverse living entities. Brahmā's devotion and transcendental knowledge made him the foremost personality in the universe, capable of creating suitable habitats for various beings.

Maitreya then described eternal time as an unchangeable force, the primeval source of material interactions controlled by the Supreme Lord for His cosmic pastimes.

Initially, Brahmā created various aspects of material existence, including nescient engagements and the four great sages: Sanaka, Sananda, Sanātana, and Sanat-kumāra. However, when his sons declined his instruction to procreate and opted for liberation, Brahmā became angry and inadvertently generated Rudra, who was pacified and assigned his duties.

Rudra, also known as Śiva, was given eleven names and residences by Brahmā. He subsequently created many fierce offspring resembling him. Concerned by their destructive nature, Brahmā advised Rudra to engage in penance. Following this, Brahmā created ten sons, the Prajāpatis, and various aspects of material and spiritual knowledge emanated from him.

The Vedas, sciences, religious principles, and societal duties all originated from Brahmā's different faces and mouths.

The birth triggered ominous natural phenomena across the heavens and earth—earthquakes, fires, and celestial disturbances. Winds howled, trees uprooted, and darkness engulfed all. The ocean mourned, animals acted erratically, and ominous planets outshone auspicious ones. Marking these omens, except Brahmā's sage sons, fear gripped all, unaware of Jaya and Vijaya's fate. The demon twins, Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu, grew with extraordinary features, intimidating all. Prajāpati Kaśyapa named them, with Hiraṇyakaśipu invincible due to Lord Brahmā's boon. Hiraṇyākṣa served his brother devotedly, displaying immense strength and indomitable spirit. His intimidating demeanor terrorized even the gods, who hid from him. Upon returning from heaven, Hiraṇyākṣa challenged Varuṇa, the ocean's lord, who advised him to confront Lord Viṣṇu. Varuṇa warned of Viṣṇu's might and predicted Hiraṇyākṣa's defeat. Despite Varuṇa's counsel, Hiraṇyākṣa persisted, blinded by arrogance.

Despite the demon's insults and threats, the Lord remained composed, bearing the pain of his abusive words. Brahmā and the demigods hailed the Lord's valor as He transferred His energy to the earth, enabling her to float on the water's surface. The demon, adorned with wealth and armaments, pursued the Lord with a mighty mace. However, the Lord, unperturbed, rebuked the demon's arrogance, prompting a fierce exchange between them. Brahmā, witnessing the intense battle, implored the Lord to swiftly vanquish the demon before the ominous hour arrived. Urging the Lord to use His infallible potency, Brahmā highlighted the auspicious time for victory, urging Him to eliminate the foe for the welfare of all. Recognizing the demon's impending doom as preordained by the Lord, Brahmā beseeched Him to swiftly dispatch the adversary and restore peace to the worlds.


CANTO 3 (THE STATUS QUO):::::::CHAP 19

After Brahmā's plea, the Lord, with a loving glance, accepted the prayer and heartily laughed. He then launched His mace at Hiraṇyākṣa, who struck back fiercely, causing the Lord's mace to slip from His hand. Despite the opportunity, Hiraṇyākṣa respected single combat, enraging the Lord further. The Lord invoked His Sudarśana discus as witnesses urged Him to dispatch the demon. Hiraṇyākṣa, seeing the Lord with lotus-petal eyes armed with Sudarśana, grew indignant and attacked. However, the Lord playfully dodged the mace, challenging Hiraṇyākṣa to try again. Seizing his mace once more, the demon roared and aimed it at the Lord, who effortlessly caught it. Humiliated, Hiraṇyākṣa took a trident and hurled it, only to have it shattered by the Lord's discus. Enraged, Hiraṇyākṣa attacked again, but the Lord, unperturbed, slapped him, and in retaliation, Hiraṇyākṣa struck the Lord's chest. Despite the blow, the Lord remained steady, and Hiraṇyākṣa's body was destroyed as if by a storm. Witnessing the battle, Brahmā marveled at Hiraṇyākṣa's blessed death. Addressing the Lord, the demigods praised His valor, and after defeating Hiraṇyākṣa, the Lord returned to His abode amidst a festival of praise.

Devahūti, initially disheartened by her appearance, was transformed into radiant beauty by the celestial maidens. With renewed vigor, she joyfully accompanied her husband to various celestial realms, relishing their marital bliss. As time passed swiftly, Kardama impregnated Devahūti with nine daughters through his yogic potency. However, upon realizing her husband's impending departure for ascetic life, Devahūti expressed her anguish, seeking solace and enlightenment. She acknowledged her past attachment to worldly pleasures but yearned for liberation through devotion to the Supreme Lord. Devahūti lamented her ignorance despite having the association of a saintly husband. She recognized the illusory nature of material pursuits and sought true spiritual advancement.

The duty then lies in engaging polluted consciousness in serious devotional service with detachment to gain control over mind and consciousness. Through the yoga system, one should progress to unalloyed devotion by chanting and hearing about the Supreme. Executing devotional service entails seeing all beings equally, practicing celibacy, being grave, offering results to God, and living modestly. By increasing spiritual knowledge, one transcends material consciousness, realizing freedom from false ego and seeing oneself as the soul. Liberation is attained through devoted service, firmly established in perfect knowledge and transcendental vision, removing the influence of material nature.

Kapila, moved by compassion, delineated various paths of devotional service based on qualities. Devotion in darkness, passion, or goodness corresponds to one's disposition. Unadulterated devotion entails unwavering absorption in the Supreme's transcendental name and qualities, akin to the Ganges flowing unimpeded to the ocean. Pure devotees eschew all forms of liberation, solely seeking the Lord's service. By achieving the pinnacle of devotional service, one transcends material modes, mirroring the Lord's transcendence. Dutifully performing prescribed duties, worshiping the Deity, and interacting compassionately comprise devotional practice. Such devotees see the spiritual master and all beings with reverence, avoiding association with the spiritually unadvanced.

The Supreme, as the time factor, orchestrates cosmic phenomena, inspiring awe and reverence.

The Personality of Godhead elucidated the obliviousness of materialists to the inexorable influence of time, akin to clouds ignorant of the wind's potency. Despite toiling for material gains, time, personified as the Supreme, annihilates their endeavors, prompting lamentation. The deluded materialist, ignorant of his body's impermanence, erroneously perceives the transient as permanent, nurturing attachments to family, wealth, and home. Such attachment breeds satisfaction, masking existential anxieties. Despite suffering, the materialist clings to his familial and societal roles, driven by greed and sensual indulgence. Eventually, aging and infirmity befall him, leading to a pitiful existence dependent on others' charity. At death, he encounters the dread messengers of Yamarāja, apprehended for his sinful indulgences. En route to judgment, he endures excruciating punishments, symbolizing the consequences of his actions. Finally, after enduring various torments, he is purified and reincarnated, the cycle of suffering perpetuating until he seeks spiritual liberation. Lord Kapila concludes, affirming that those ensnared in sinful pursuits endure hellish lives even on Earth, reaping the consequences of their actions. Thus, one should transcend material entanglements and strive for spiritual enlightenment to break free from the cycle of birth and death.

As the fetus develops, it longs for liberation from the cycle of birth and death, seeking refuge in the lotus feet of the Lord. Eventually, propelled by the wind of destiny, the child is born, subjected to the vicissitudes of material existence. Through childhood and boyhood, the soul grapples with the illusions of the material world, seeking fulfillment in transient pleasures. However, the pursuit of sensual gratification only deepens the entanglement in material bondage.

The Personality of Godhead explains the consequences of materialistic pursuits, emphasizing attachment to sense gratification over devotional service. Those engrossed in mundane rituals and economic endeavors remain bereft of spiritual consciousness, continually entangled in material desires.

Liberation is attained by approaching the complete Personality of Godhead, who orchestrates the material and spiritual realms. The text highlights the futility of material aspirations and the importance of taking shelter in the Supreme Lord for spiritual advancement.
